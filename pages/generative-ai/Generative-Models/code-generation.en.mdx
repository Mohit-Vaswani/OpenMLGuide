# Code Generation

AI code generation automates the creation of software code using machine learning models. It interprets human-readable descriptions and generates code, streamlining development processes and making coding more accessible to non-developers.

### Articles & Papers

- [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex) (2021) by OpenAI, is based on GPT-3, translates natural language into code for various programming tasks. Proficient in multiple languages, it aids in code transpilation, explanation, and refactoring. Codex is integral to GitHub Copilot, bridging the gap between English instructions and popular coding languages. [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374)

- [Competitive programming with AlphaCode](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/competitive-programming-with-alphacode) (2021): AlphaCode, developed by DeepMind, is a natural language-to-code system based on GPT-3. It excels in competitive programming, achieving a rank within the top 54% of participants and outperforming human programmers in multiple contests on Codeforces. AlphaCode combines natural language understanding with problem-solving and statistical power, offering valuable assistance to human programmers.

- [Conversational AI Programming with CodeGen: Let AI Write Code For You](https://blog.salesforceairesearch.com/codegen/) (2022) by Salesforce AI, is a conversational AI programming system that generates code based on developer prompts. Operating as a natural language-to-code system, it can sample executable code by adjusting model and dataset sizes, adding conversational capabilities. CodeGen aids programmers at all levels, streamlining the programming process and democratizing software development. [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13474)

- [Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP): Recursively Self-Improving Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02304) (2023) by Microsoft, STOP is an innovative code generation method that iteratively enhances itself. It begins with an initial "improver" program that uses a language model to boost solutions for different tasks. STOP refines this improver, generating significantly better code. While it's not fully Recursively Self-Improving, it demonstrates the potential of modern language models for efficient self-improvement in code generation.
