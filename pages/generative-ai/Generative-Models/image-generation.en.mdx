# Image Generation

AI image generation involves using artificial intelligence to create visual content, including images and artwork. These systems can generate pictures from text descriptions, enhance photos, or produce entirely new images based on various inputs and preferences.

### Articles & Papers

- [CLIP: Connecting text and images ](https://openai.com/research/clip) (2021) by OpenAI connects text and images, bridging computer vision and natural language processing. Motivated by addressing challenges in deep learning and enabling zero-shot transfer, CLIP's evaluation is robust. However, it requires careful prompt engineering, and concerns regarding biases persist [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020). 

- [DALLÂ·E: Creating images from text ](https://openai.com/research/dall-e) (2021) is an AI system that crafts images from text descriptions. It's a transformer model trained to generate images in high resolution and offers creative applications [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12092).
