# Mastering the Mathematical Foundations of ML

While mathematics is a valuable part of ML, it's not always necessary to grasp it fully from the outset. Start by learning to code, building projects, and gaining practical experience. [High school-level math](http://localhost:3000/Foundational-Learning/Mastering-Maths#courses) is often sufficient for many ML tasks. Later, as you grow more comfortable with the field, you can gradually delve into the deeper mathematical concepts. This approach accommodates learners from various backgrounds and allows you to get your hands dirty with real-world applications before diving into the math. However, if you have a strong interest in understanding the mathematics behind machine learning, you can explore additional resources.
